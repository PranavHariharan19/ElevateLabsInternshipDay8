Day 8
I have built a General Knowledge Quiz application.
The program contains a Question class which includes a question,it's options and the correct answer.
It also has a method iscorrect to check if the answer enteres by the user is corrct or not.
The main class contains an ArrayList of questions and also keeps track of the score of the user.
After all the questions the score is displayed.
